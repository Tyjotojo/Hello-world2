This repository is for practicing GitHub 
Hey, Thought I'd take this time to introduce myself.
I'm not new to tech, I'm just giving it another try.
The older I get the more I understand there is more than one way to reach your goals.
I have to remind myself that though I am older coming into this, I can still add value, when some may say I don't.
